# Brain-Tumor-Classification-CNN
This project focuses on the classification of brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. The dataset consists of MRI images categorized into four types: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumors. The goal of the project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify brain tumors.
